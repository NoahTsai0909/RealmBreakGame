## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
As a portfolio piece, this project showcases clean, decoupled architecture and highly polished UI implementation within Unity:

* **ScriptableObject Architecture:** All game events (Combat, Level Ups, Story Events) and Unit definitions are driven by modular ScriptableObjects, allowing for rapid design iteration without touching core code.
* **Decoupled Combat System:** Built on a custom `CombatEventBus`, ensuring that unit stats, damage calculations, and UI updates (like damage numbers and health bars) communicate seamlessly without rigid dependencies.
* **Advanced UI & UX:** 
  * Features a dynamic, scale-aware tooltip system.
  * Utilizes `TextMeshPro` with precise Layout Groups for flawless scaling across resolutions.
  * Cinematic UI transitions driven by programmatic animations (bouncy pop-ins, heavy slams, and color adjustments).
